# Stock Data Visualizer

A containerized Flask application that allows users to visualize stock price data using charts generated with **Pygal**.  
Users can select:

- Stock symbol  
- Chart type (Bar or Line)  
- Time series (Intraday, Daily, Weekly, Monthly)  
- Start and end dates  

The application loads stock symbols from a CSV file and retrieves price data from the **AlphaVantage API**.
